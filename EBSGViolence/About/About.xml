Expanded Biotech Style Genes(EBSG) is the step beyond [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2985153870]More Biotech Style Genes[/url]. Where that series sought to expand ranges that already exist, this series seeks to add ranges that should exist. You get gene ranges that alter sleep fall rate, but why not a range for changing the rate it recovers? If you can have fire resistance genes, why not have genes to resist other types of damage like frostbite and acid?

This mod adds 24 new genes that alter how a pawn performs in combat. Will they be cautious, avoiding careless mistakes as much as possible, or will they aim to put as many bullets in the air and punches to the face as possible. There are 12 genes that impact shooting ability, and 12 that impact melee capabilities. 

The shooting genes while multiplying the accuracy and aiming delay by an additional 10%. For example, Very Careful Shooter multiplies both accuracy and aiming delay factor by 1.3, increasing the time it takes to shoot while increasing accuracy, while Very Twitchy Shooter multiplies both accuracy and aiming delay factor by 0.7. The melee genes multiplying accuracy by and melee dodge chance in the opposite direction. For example, the Very Cautious Brawler gene multiplies melee dodge chance by 1.3, and accuracy by 0.7, while Very Reckless Brawler multiplies accuracy by 1.3, and melee dodge chance by 0.7.

This mod will eventually be put into Expanded Biotech Style Genes - All in One. If that mod exists and you still see this message, please let me know I forgot to add the link here.
